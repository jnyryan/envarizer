# envarizer

takes a bash shell export command and turns it into a json object

Why you ask? I found myself doing it more than once by hand.

## Installation

This is a Node.js package so need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime to be used

```
npm install envarizer
```

## Usage

```
envarizer ./test/test-file.txt
```
